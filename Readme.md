# RideBuddy

An Android app that records cycling data (using GPS) and allows the user to add custom markers just by double tapping the smartphone (with the screen off). 
This way it allows the cyclist to interact with the phone without taking his eyes from the road.
It also has the ability to detect falls or accidents, calling for help to one number defined by the user.

This application was built in my Master's mobile computing class.
